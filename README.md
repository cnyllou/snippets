snippets for all frameworks and programming languages I use/have used.

# What is included?
- Python
	- Flask
- Ruby
	- Appium Mobile Automation
- Pascal
- Windows
	- Batch(CMD)
	- Power shell
- Linux
	- Bash
- vim (config?)

# What else?
I gathered this from StackOverflow/Exchange etc. and some include templates, like for Ruby appium and Python Flask


# How I do it?
If I find a code piece that might be useful later I will most likely save it in my snippets or if I seem to go back to the same stack overflow post over again I will also save it.

For templates/skeletons I make sure to keep those also, because there is a chance I will forget them and it's more efficient this way, so I don't need to type it in again or look through my source code for this.

Another efficient way for templates is creating snippets for them in an IDE, for me it's Atom, the snippets.cson file is not hard to edit and I can efficiently use my snips. :)
